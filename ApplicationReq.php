				Admission to UNC Charlotte has become increasingly competitive.
				Because of the limited number of spaces available in our incoming
				freshman class, applicants who apply late in the admissions cycle
				are expected to present an academic profile that exceeds our
				freshman averages (see chart below). If your grades and test scores
				do not meet this elevated criteria, we encourage you to consider
				future transfer options. Many students attend another university or
				a community college for one year, transfer to UNC Charlotte, and
				fulfill their educational goals. Please review our transfer student
				admission criteria</a> for more information.
